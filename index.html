			For some Staten Island voters, casting city council ballots next month might not be as simple as voting red or blue. Sarah Blas, a community advocate with a background in public health, is running to represent the North Shore under two additional tickets — one as an independent, and another under the progressive Working Families Party.
			<br><br>
			On Nov. 4, Blas will face Democratic incumbent Kamillah Hanks and Republican challenger John Shea in the election for New York City Council’s 49th district. The district spans most of Staten Island north of Interstate 278, including the neighborhoods of Stapleton, West New Brighton, Port Richmond and St. George.
			<br><br>
			Hanks defeated Blas in the Democratic primary earlier this year, winning more than 58% of the vote. Blas finished in third at about 15%, and said it was difficult to defeat an incumbent in the crowded primary race. But Blas said her desire to represent the North Shore pushed her toward a third-party campaign — and that supporting K-12 education is a cornerstone of her candidacy.
			<br><br>
			Blas spoke with <em>NYCity News Service</em> about how she would address K-12 education as a councilmember. <em>NYCity News Service</em> has compiled her stances on four key education issues: chronic absenteeism, public school enrollment, school funding and universal after-school care.

		<section class="content-block">
			<h2>Chronic absenteeism</h2>

		<p class="chartWrapper">
			<iframe title="Chronically Absent Students In Staten Island, By Percent" aria-label="Interactive column graph" id="datawrapper-chart-iE1P6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/L76KV/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</script>
		</p>

			<p>The New York State Education Department <a ref="https://www.nysed.gov/innovation-school-reform/chronic-absenteeism">defines chronic absenteeism</a> as “missing 10% of school days within one academic year for any reason.”</p>

			<p>Rates of chronic absenteeism <a ref="https://www.the74million.org/article/chronic-absenteeisms-post-covid-new-normal-research-shows-it-is-more-common-more-extreme/">shot up in schools nationwide</a> with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, including in Staten Island. Between 2019 and 2021, the percentage of chronically absent students in the borough’s public schools <a ref="https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/students-and-schools/school-quality/information-and-data-overview/end-of-year-attendance-and-chronic-absenteeism-data">rose by roughly 15%</a>. Chronic absenteeism remained above pre-pandemic levels in the 2023-24 school year.</p>

			<p> Blas said reducing chronic absenteeism rates requires addressing school issues that impact student attendance. She said that includes facility improvements, removing issues like mold and allergens.</p>

			<p> Blas also called for the expansion of in-school access to medical services that can make attendance easier for students with health conditions that affect attendance, like asthma intervention. She said health needs can be incorporated into Individualized Education Plans for students, which offer <a ref="https://www.nysed.gov/special-education/individualized-education-program-iep">specialized services</a> for students with disabilities.</p>

			<p> “We can't blame parents alone. We can't blame educators alone,” Blas said. “We've got to look at the lens of what makes a child successful in school.”</p>

			<h2>Public school enrollment</h2>

		<p class="chartWrapper">
			<iframe title="Staten Island Public School Enrollment, 2018-2023" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-iE1P6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Owbxu/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</script>
		</p>

			<p>Public school enrollment has declined across New York City in recent years, many due to concerns pertaining to <a ref="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2025/04/11/why-do-nyc-families-leave-public-school-safety-instruction-survey/">school safety and quality of instruction</a>. In 2024, public school enrollment was <a ref="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/11/15/nyc-public-school-enrollment-flat-but-below-pre-pandemic-numbers/">down by roughly 100,000 students</a> compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

			<p>The drop has been less pronounced in Staten Island, but data from the New York Department of Education indicates enrollment <a ref="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/space-and-facilities/district-planning/district-planning-document-library/odp-document-library-archive/2024-2025-data-summaries">fell by roughly 5%</a> between 2019 and 2023.</p>

			<p>Blas previously ran for Community Education Council and chaired Staten Island’s <a ref="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enrollment-help/meeting-student-needs/diversity-in-admissions">Diversity in Admissions</a> committee. From these experiences, she said quality of instruction concerns and a desire for religious education were recurring reasons families cited for leaving public schools.</p>

			<p>While Blas said religious education is a separate issue, she said improving accessibility and funding for individualized education plans is a crucial first step toward improving enrollment. She said the district should also look into why so many students are depending on individual education plans in the first place, and work to strengthen them.</p>

			<p>“A lot of parents have children with individual education plans that are not feeling like they’re getting their needs met in public school,” Blas said. “I believe in fully funding our public schools. But I also think while there are gaps in educational services, families should have options.”</p>

			<h2>School funding</h2><br>

			<p>
				Blas is an advocate for participatory budgeting — a process where community members vote to direct a portion of city funding toward community projects of their choosing, according to the <a ref="https://council.nyc.gov/pb/">New York City Council website</a>. She said enabling this process for the North Shore would help local schools and educators obtain much-needed city money.
			</p>

			<p>
				“First and foremost, our educators are spending way too much of their own personal budgets on classrooms,” Blas said. “We do have a large group of nonprofit organizations that fill in the gap. But I really do believe that that should come from the city budget.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Blas said people across the education industry, from teachers to bus drivers to service providers, need better funding to meet the needs of their communities. 
			</p>

			<p>
				“When we think about fully funding our schools, we really have to think about every component that makes a school work,” she said.
			</p>

			<p>
				For fiscal year 2026, 24 members of city council implemented participatory budgeting for their districts. But incumbent Hanks and the 49th district were <a ref="https://council.nyc.gov/pb/results/cycle-8-results/">not included among them</a>.

			<h2>Universal after-school care</h2>
					<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For too long, too many of our working-class families have been denied access to affordable child care, including options for young children and after-school programming.<br><br>We're changing that by investing millions toward universal after-school:<a href="https://t.co/WE11is4tHO">pic.twitter.com/WE11is4tHO</a></p>&mdash; Office of Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1952017998723633228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
			<p>
				On Sept. 12, Mayor Eric Adams signed an executive order to develop plans for universal after-school care across the city’s public schools <a ref="https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2025/09/mayor-adams-signs-executive-order-to-establish-new-commission-on">through a new commission</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Pushes for universal after-school care have been a recurring talking point in the ongoing mayoral race, of which Adams has since dropped out. Candidates <a ref="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/business/universal-child-care-us-economy.html">Zohran Mamdani</a> and <a ref="https://www.andrewcuomo.com/press/cuomo-announces-innovative-plan-replace-chronically-underperforming-schools-strengthen-nys">Andrew Cuomo</a> have both called for making access to after-school services for the city’s youth universal.
			</p>

			<p>
				Blas said she supports the effort, and would review bill proposals that could make universal after-school care a reality.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Not every family needs it. But many families, especially the ones I’ve spoken to in this district, do,” Blas said. “It can be the difference between someone  being able to pay their rent. It could be the difference between a student getting extra tutoring after school and passing to the next grade.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Blass added that it does not just support educators and parents, but “it’s essential to students as well.”
